Dealing With Display Problems 

On Startup 
Ren'Py requires that your computer has functioning graphics acceleration
hardware, such as a GPU or a CPU with integrated graphics. Ren'Py will
automatically choose between the following renderers, in order.
These are the classic renderers that were used from Ren'Py 6.13 to Ren'Py
7.4. These may not be available in 7.4 and later games that require
model-based rendering.

gl: OpenGL 2.0 or greater.
angle: Windows, DirectX 9 or DirectX 11.
gles: OpenGL ES 3.0.

These are model-based renderers present in Ren'Py 7.4 and later. These
currently exist to enable new features, and are expected to become the
default renderer in the future.

gl2: OpenGL 2.0 or greater.
angle2: Windows, DirectX 9 or DirectX 11.
gles2: OpenGL ES 3.0.

Older versions of Ren'Py supported a software renderer, but this has
been removed.
A small fraction of systems may experience problems when running
hardware accelerated Ren'Py games.  These problems are often due to
buggy graphics drivers, and so your first step to fixing them should
be to check for an update to your graphics card drivers.
If upgrading your video drivers does not fix the problem, you should
consider switching video renderers, using the following steps.

Hold down Shift while starting Ren'Py, or press Shift+G once Ren'Py has started.
From the "Graphics Acceleration" menu that appears, choose the renderer to use.
Choose "Quit", then restart Ren'Py.

We suggest trying the GL and ANGLE renderers. The GLES renderers may not function
on desktop hardware.


On Suspend/Resume 
We have had reports of systems that lose textures when a computer is suspened
and resumed. This is likely a problem with the computer or its device drivers,
but it is possible to force Ren'Py to reload the textures by resizing the
window, or pressing the F key to toggle fullscreen mode.



Windows Encoding Problems 
Ren'Py will fail to start on Windows if it's placed in a directory with a
full path that isn't representable in the current system language. For example,
if Ren'Py is in the directory:
C:\ãã¸ã¥ã¢ã«ããã«\renpy-6.16.0-sdk\


and the system is set to use the English language, Ren'Py will be unable to
start. To fix this problem, start the control panel, select "Region and Language
Options", "Advanced", and change the Language for non-Unicode programs.


OS X 10.9 Mavericks 
A bug in OS X 10.9 Mavericks prevents Ren'Py from starting when launched
on a non-primary display. Until Apple fixes this bug, please launch Ren'Py from
the the primary display.


64-Bit Linux Problems 
Ren'Py 6.14.x and 6.15.0-3 were compiled incorrectly, and will often
fail to operate on 64-bit Linux computers. The best way to work around
this is to download Ren'Py 6.15.4 or later, and use it to run the game:
/path/to/renpy-6.15.4/renpy.sh /path/to/game-with-problems
