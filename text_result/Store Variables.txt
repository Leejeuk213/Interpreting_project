Store Variables 
Ren'Py has a number of store variables that control its function. Store
variables may be changed at any time. If a store variable is changed after
the game has started, it will be be saved and loaded by the save system,
and rolled-back when rollback occurs.


adv = Character(...) 
This is a template ADV-mode character, and the default character kind
that is used when Character() is called.



_autosave = True 
This variable can be set to False to disable autosave.



_confirm_quit = True 
This determines if quitting the game asks for confirmation. It is
set to False during the splashscreen, and is ignored when in the main
menu.



default_mouse 
This is undefined by default. If defined, and if config.mouse is
set at game startup, this is a key that is used to look up a mouse cursor
when the current cursor does not exist, or is the default. This is used by
config.mouse and MouseDisplayable().



_dismiss_pause = True 
If True, the player can dismiss pauses and transitions.



_game_menu_screen = "save" 
This is the screen that is displayed when entering the game menu with no
more specific screen selected. (For example, when right-clicking, pressing
escape, or when ShowMenu() is not given an argument.) If None, entry
to the game menu is disallowed.
This is set to None at the start of the splashscreen, and restored to its
original value when the splashscreen ends.



_history = True 
If true, Ren'Py will record dialogue history when a line is shown. (Note
that config.history_list_length must be set as well.)



_history_list = [ ] 
This is a list of history objects, corresponding to each line of history
from oldest to newest. See the History section for more
information.



_ignore_action = None 
When this is not None, it's an action that is run after clicking Ignore
on the error handling screen. The action is usually Jump(), to jump
the game to a place that can recover from an error. If None, control
continues with the next Ren'Py statement.



main_menu = False 
Ren'Py sets this variable to True while in the main menu. This can be used
to have screens display differently while in the main menu.



_menu = False 
Ren'Py sets this variable to True when entering a main menu or game menu
context.



menu = renpy.display_menu 
The function that's called to display the in-game menu. It should take the same
arguments as renpy.display_menu(). Assigning nvl_menu() to this
will display an nvl-mode menu.



mouse_visible = True 
Controls if the mouse is visible. This is automatically set to true when
entering the standard game menus.



name_only = Character(...) 
This is a template character that is used when a string is given as the
character name in a say statement. This:
"Eileen" "Hello, world."


is equivalent to:
$ temp_char = Character("Eileen", kind=name_only)
temp_char "Hello, world."


except that the temp_char variable is not used.



narrator = Character(...) 
This is the character that speaks narration (say statements that do not
give a character or character name). This:
"Hello, world."


is equivalent to:
narrator "Hello, world."





_quit_slot = None 
If not None, this should be a string giving the name of a file slot.
When Ren'Py quits, the game will be saved in this slot.



_rollback = True 
Controls if rollback is allowed.



say = ... 
A function that is called by Ren'Py to display dialogue. This is called
with three arguments. The first argument (who) is the character saying the
dialogue (or None for the narrator). The second argument (what) is what dialogue
is being said.
The third argument must be a keyword argument named interact and defaulting
to True. If true, the say function will wait for a click. If false, it will
immediately return with the dialogue displayed on the screen.
It's rare to call this function directly, as one can simply call a character
with dialogue. This variable mostly exists to be redefined, as a way of
hooking the say statement.



save_name = "" 
A save name that is included with saves.



_screenshot_pattern = None 
If not None, this string is used in preference to config.screenshot_pattern
to determine the filename of a screenshot. Please see the documentation for
that variable for the format of the string.



_skipping = True 
Controls if skipping is allowed.



_version = ... 
This is set to config.version when a new game is started. It can be
used by the after_load label or config.after_load_callbacks to
determine which upgrades need to be done.
This is only set once, upon the initial start. After that, the game is
responsible for updating _version as necessary.



_window = False 
This set by the window show and window hide statements, and indirectly
by window auto. If true, the dialogue window is shown during non-dialogue
statements.



_window_auto = False 
This is set to true by window auto and to false by window show and
window hide. If true, the window auto behavior occurs.



_window_subtitle = '' 
This is appended to config.window_title to produce the caption for the game
window. This is automatically set to config.menu_window_subtitle while in
the game menu.
